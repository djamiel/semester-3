        <h2>Studio Ghibli</h2>
        <p>Studio Ghibli Inc. is a Japanese
          animation studio headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo. It is best known for its animated feature films, and has
          also produced several short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. Its mascot and most
          recognizable symbol is a character named Totoro, a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (tanuki) and cats
          from the 1988 anime film My Neighbor Totoro. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are Spirited Away
          (2001), Howl's Moving Castle (2004) and Ponyo (2008). The studio was founded on June 15, 1985, by directors
          Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the successful performance of Topcraft's
          Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1984). It has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual
          development of several games.</p>
