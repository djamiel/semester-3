# Valorant gun gallery

This project is a test to see if i can fetch an API myself. I wanted to fetch an online API so i fetched the official valorant API. The point was to make a simple gun gallery. I also made some buttons to sort through the catagory's of the guns. I automaticaly put them in flexboxes that are already styled with css. I do this with a "for loop"/
